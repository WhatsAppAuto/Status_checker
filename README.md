# Status_checker
This is a automation script written in Nodejs that just monitors certain profiles to know when they came online, using whatsapp web.

# Limitations
As I have already mentioned, the script uses whatsapp web, so it means you have to register yourself through whatsapp web option in your whatsapp application to reach the interface of whatsap web . if you not do so you wont be able to reach the interface of whatsap web, it won't register.
But the best thing is this script gets localStorage from brower and uses it to login for the next time . So you only have to register once.
  
# Installation
Clone the git repository by using the clone url above.
Navigate to the folder you just cloned
Go to cmd -> run commands -> 
1. npm install chrome driver
2. npm install selenium-webdriver
3. node wAscript.js

That's it
